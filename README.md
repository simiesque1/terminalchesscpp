# terminalchesscpp ♟️
really basic implementation of the chess game, into the terminal (in c++)

You can either compile it yourself, or use the .exe in releases

I didn't implement the check nor en passant, because my goal was learning c++ and that's what I did; didn't feel the need to do it.

## Usage example :

It is really basic, I used the French notation for the pawn names etc. T stands for Rook ; C for Knight ; F for Bishop ; D for Queen ; R for King and P for pawn.

You enter the square of your piece, and then the destination square.
